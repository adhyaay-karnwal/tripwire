// Public entry point for @tripwire/core.

// Business logic on top of @tripwire/db:
//   - events       : event-log writer + reputation roll-up
//   - reputation   : score reset / forgiveness
//   - contributor  : pure scoring algorithm (no I/O)
//   - filter       : the moderation pipeline that evaluates rules against PRs
//   - rules        : zod schemas + draft/diff helpers for rule configs
//   - signals      : atomic signal definitions + resolveAllSignals
//   - blocks       : workflow block definitions + evaluators + NODE_REGISTRY
